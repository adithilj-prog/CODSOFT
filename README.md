##  Tasks Completed

###  Task‑01: Calculator Application
- Built a simple **calculator program** in Python.  
- Implemented core operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.  
- Tested functionality with sample inputs and edge cases.  
- Deliverable: `calculator.py`

---

###  Task‑02: Tic‑Tac‑Toe AI
- Implemented an **unbeatable Tic‑Tac‑Toe AI** using the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha‑Beta pruning**.  
- Human plays as `X`, AI plays as `O`.  
- Input format: row and column (1–3).  
- Validated moves and ensured optimal AI responses.  
- Deliverable: `tic_tac_toe.cpp` (or your chosen filename).

###  Task‑03: Image Captioning Project
- Built an **AI captioning pipeline** using ResNet50 + LSTM.  
- Steps included dataset preparation, feature extraction, model training, inference, and evaluation.  
- Implemented greedy and beam search decoding for caption generation.  
- Evaluated results using BLEU scores:  
  - BLEU‑1: ~0.38  
  - BLEU‑2: ~0.19  
  - BLEU‑3: ~0.11  
  - BLEU‑4: ~0.02  
- Deliverables:  
  - `Task-03.md` → Documentation  
  - `main.py` → Training + inference code  
  - `caption_model.keras` → Saved trained model  
  - `tokenizer.pkl` → Saved tokenizer  
  - `features.pkl` → Extracted image features  

---
### Task‑04: Movie Recommendation System
- Developed a **content‑based movie recommendation system** using the **MovieLens dataset**.  
- Combined movie genres and tags into feature vectors.  
- Applied **TF‑IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to compute similarity scores.  
- Implemented a recommendation function that suggests the top 5 similar movies for a given title.  
- Deliverables:  
  - `Task-04.md` → Documentation  
  - `recommend.py` → Core recommendation logic
